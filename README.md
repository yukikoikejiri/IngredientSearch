# Software Design 
This is the template for the team project of the Software Design course at the Vrije Universiteit Amsterdam. 

When submitting your project, remember to make a [GitHub release](https://docs.github.com/en/repositories/releasing-projects-on-github/managing-releases-in-a-repository) containing the fat Jar of your project in the `out` folder here. The fat Jar is the result of the full build of your project via Gradle.

The fat Jar must be runnable using a simple `java -jar <fat jar>` command.
